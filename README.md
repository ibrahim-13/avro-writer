# Avro Writer

> Minimalistic application to write Bangla with Avro

This project uses the **`Avro JavaScript Library`** from **`Avro-Pad`** to show suggestions. **`Avro`** is wrapped in a [Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) to make the app even more faster.

### Production build of this project is hosted on Github Pages of this repository
[https://ibrahim-13.github.io/avro-writer/](https://ibrahim-13.github.io/avro-writer/)

**This application works off-line and you can also install to use it as an application**

**You can find help for installing PWA on your device from here - [https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?&hl=en](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?&hl=en)**
